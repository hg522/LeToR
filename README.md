# LeToR
Learning to Rank problem using Machine Learning

Used machine learning to solve the problem of learning to rank using linear regression and compare two solutions namely close-form solution and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solution. LeToR dataset is used for this problem which contains 69623 query-document pairs with 46 features in each row. Accuracy and RMSE values for training, validation and test data are calculated and compared.
